## Learning Goal:

We want to achieve two things:

1. Install [**R**][r-project], the programming language. 
  This allows you to execute R code and run R scripts.
2. Install **RStudio**, an *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE) for R. 
  This provides a user-friendly interface to write and run R code.   
  It is not strictly necessary to work with R, but it is **highly recommended** for everyone who does not already have a strong preference in this regard[^1].


[^1]: If you prefer to use Emacs, you are encourage to use [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/). If you prefer (Neo)vim, there also is [nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R). You may also want to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r) if you prefer. Or Try the still in development [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) if you feel adventurous.

### Installing R {#install-r}

To install R, you need to download the installer from [CRAN][cran], the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork and is the official repository for R packages and R itself. The website itself may look a little dated, which is mostly due to it being, in fact, a little dated.

![The CRAN home page](img/cran-download-list.png){#fig-cran fig-alt="The CRAN home page"}

Here you find direct links to download R for Windows, macOS and Linux --- but please note that for Linux, I provide additional instructions below that do not make use of CRAN.

![Download links for common platforms](img/cran-download-win-mac.png){#fig-cran fig-alt="Highlighted links to Download R for macOS and Windows"}

If you are on Windows or macOS, proceed to the appropriate option here.
Please note that I have extensive experience on macOS and various Linux distributions, but I do not have any recent experience with Windows.
If you find these instructions lacking, please refer to [the linked video guides](#video-guides) for additional resources.

Now, click on the tab for your operating system for the next steps.

::: {.panel-tabset}


#### Windows

You will be presented with multiple links, but the relevant one is the **base** version of R, which includes R with the core components.

![The R for Windows listing page](img/cran-windows-base-box.png){#fig-r-win-list1 fig-alt="Various download links for R on Windows, including base and RTools"}

Click on it and you will be greeted with this page:

<!-- ![The CRAN home page](img/cran-windows.png){#fig-cran fig-alt="The CRAN home page"} -->
![Download link for Windows](img/cran-windows-box.png){#fig-r-win-download fig-alt="Highlighted link 'Download R-4.4.2' for Windows"}

Here, click the highlighted download link to download the installer.

Run the installer on your PC and follow the instructions.
You may be asked to accept the usual licenses of course, and can accept nay other defaults.

##### Optional: RTools

While you are here, you might as well also install **RTools**.  
You may not need this at first, but at some point in the future you may be asked to, for example, install an in-development R package from a different source than CRAN. In these cases it may be necessary to compile the package from source, which requires additional compilers and tools --- this is what RTools provides.

Navigate back to the overview site where you found **base** R and look for the link to **RTools**.

![The R for Windows listing page](img/cran-windows-rtools-link.png){#fig-r-win-list2 fig-alt="THe previous listing page, highlight the link to Rtools"}

Click on the link to **RTools** 4.4 (or whichever is the most recent version) and download the installer.

![The RTools overview page](img/cran-windows-rtools-download.png){#fig-rtools fig-alt="Listing page showing download links to RTools for various R versions with the most recent one on top"}

Run the installer and you should be good to go!

#### macOS

The download page for macOS is quite simple: For reasonably modern systems, you can just click the top link to download the latest version of R for macOS.

Click on the top link to download the latest version of R for macOS on recent Apple computers. 
For older systems (pre 2020's Apple Silicon), you may need to use second link for Intel Macs.

![The macOS download page](img/cran-macos-highlight.png){#fig-r-mac fig-alt="The CRAN home page"}

For even older systems you may need to scroll down further for *"Binaries for legacy macOS/OS X systems"*, but I do not have experience with installing R on legacy systems unfortunately.

In any case, you will have downloaded a `.pkg` file, which you can run by double-clicking it and following the instructions, accepting any defaults that may come up.

#### Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

Rather than installing R from CRAN, I have made very good experience with a tool called [**rig**](https://github.com/r-lib/rig?tab=readme-ov-file#the-r-installation-manager).

You can install it on many Linux platforms, including Ubuntu, by following the instructions provided [in it's documentation](https://github.com/r-lib/rig?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-rig-on-linux-).

After installing it, you can install R by running the following command in your terminal:


```sh
rig add release
```

Afterwards, running `R` in your terminal should start R.

:::

Whichever path you chose, you should now have R installed on your system!


### Installing RStudio {#install-rstudio}

Now we can move on to install RStudio, the IDE for R.
We get it from the [Positron website][posit-rstudio], where you will find a download link for **RStudio Desktop**.

![Posit's download page for RStudio Desktop](img/rstudio-header.png){fig-alt=""}

You will likely find two large buttons, one for installing R --- which you presumably already did! If not, please scroll up on this site.

The second link hopefully links to the download for RStudio on your system, but if not, you can find the appropriate link in the list below.

![The big download button which should be appropriate for your system](img/rstudio-big-box.png){fig-alt=""}

Here you find download links for Windows, macOS, various versions of Ubuntu, and less common Linux distributions.

![Download links for RStudio for various platforms](img/rstudio-list-box.png){fig-alt=""}

Click on the appropriate link for your system to download the installer, and run it just like you did the R installer before or however else you typically install software.

### Checking the Installation {#check-installation}

After installing R and RStudio, you can check if everything is working by opening RStudio.
Depending on your platform you might either find a desktop shortcut showing the RStudio logo or you can find it in your applications menu.

![The RStudio Logo](img/RStudio-logo-Flat.png){width="300" fig-alt="A blue ball with the letter R in it, with 'Studio' right next to it"}

When you open RStudio, you should see a window similar to the one below.

![An empty RStudio session with nothing in it](img/rstudio-open.png){#fig-rstudio-empty fig-alt="An empty RStudio window with 4 quadrants"}

The left half constitutes the *console* view, where you can type and execute R code directly.
We will now try installing the [tidyverse][https://www.tidyverse.org/], a collection of packages that are very useful for data analysis and visualization. The `tidyverse` package itself is a collection of multiple other packages, each in turn providing different functionality.
In R, packages have to be installed _once_ and then _loaded_ in each new session.

Type

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

and press enter. You should see some activity in the console, and after a while you should see a message that the package was installed successfully. The text may be red, but that does not necessarily imply there was an error!

![The RStudio console after successfully installing the `tidyverse` package](img/rstudio-open-install.png){#fig-tidyverse fig-alt="R message showing 'Attaching core tidyverse packages' dplyr, ggplot2, etc. and informing of conflicts between dplyr::filter and stats::filter and dplyr::lag and stats::lag"}

Finally, type 

```r
library("tidyverse")
```

and press enter. If you do not see any error messages, you have successfully installed R and RStudio, and even set up the tidyverse already!
